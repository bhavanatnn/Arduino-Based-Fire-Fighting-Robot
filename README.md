# Arduino-Based-Fire-Fighting-Robot
Designed and developed an Arduino-based fire fighting robot capable of detecting fire and extinguishing it automatically.  The system uses a flame sensor to detect fire, DC motors for movement, a relay-controlled water pump for fire suppression, and a servo for directional spraying.  This project provided hands-on experience in embedded systems.
